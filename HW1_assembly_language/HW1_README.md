## HW1 Explanation

In this homework, we use [Jupiter](https://github.com/andrescv/Jupiter) as our RISC-V assembler.

The homework can be separated into 2 parts. The first one is solving a recursive function, while the second one is creating a caesar cipher using ASCII.

### How to run the files

To run the files,

1. Open the file in Jupiter.

2. Click "Run" on the top of the screen.

3. View what happen inside the simulator.

That's it!
